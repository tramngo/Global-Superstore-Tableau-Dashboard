## Tool: Tableau Public
This project is designed from Vivek P's Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-tableau-fundamentals/
## Problem Statement 
Here we have a global superstore order details database, and we need to find the most profitable seller states in the USA.
## Actions Taken in Tableau Public
1. Create a line chart to show total sales over time for each segment.
2. Currency should be in dollars ($$$).
3. Apply filters so that users can select the particular segment.
4. Create a map chart to show the top 10 selller states in the USA based on profitability.
5. Create a Cross Tab to show the top 10 overall profitable states along with total sales.
6. Create a dashboard to include line and map charts and publish it on Tableau Public.
7. Download the published chart in PDF.
